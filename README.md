Harvard Secondary Summer School

This website details personal and interesting information about me, Amy Zhou.
I have included links to my portfolio, things I do for fun in my spare time, my passion for STEM, and general facts about me.
Each html page consists of links to the other pages in a navigation bar at the top of the screen. When the mouse hovers over a link name, the color changes from gray to black.
Below are what each html file contains and the Project0 requirements that are fulfilled:

    Below the title, there are links to the 4 other html pages. Hovering over a link name will underline the word(s).
