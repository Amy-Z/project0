This website details information about me, Amy Zhou.
As you navigate through the links, you will discover compelling facts about my personal hobbies, interests in STEM, character traits, and samples of my work in the arts.

The links in my website are Home, Fun, STEM, About Amy, and Portfolio, which are located in a navigation panel at the top of each html page in my website.

Navigation menu: When the mouse hovers over the name of a link, the link changes color from gray to black.
The navigation bar is a component of Bootstrap; linking to Bootstrap affects the links' appearance as well as the overall look of the toolbar.

I use Bootstrap columns in all of my html pages.
There are 3 columns on each page: 2 for padding against the viewport edges and a large one for the body of the page.

When the viewport is reduced in size, the size of the text shrinks to accommodate for the smaller screen.

When you highlight any element in my website, the highlight color is light pink, and the highlighted words become red.
This feature was included to satisfy one of the ::selection requirements.



Index.html
	Index.html is the home page of my website.
In the body, you can find links to the other 4 html pages. Hovering over a link changes the color of the text and underlines it.
	Below the links, there are images contained in flexboxes. Flexboxes are important design elements that promote a flexible responsive layout structure in my website.

Fun.html
	Fun.html details the activities I enjoy doing in my free time, as well as the most interesting places I have been in my life.
	The things I enjoy in my free time are organized in an ordered list. The list is styled with scss nesting.
	The table consists of the favorite places I have been, detailing the location, year I went, and the best part of the trip. Table properties are specified in the css stylesheet, including row colors, borders, and text qualities.

Stem.html
	stem.html catalogs my passion for STEM both in school and at work.
	The Work and School subtitles demonstrate scss inheritance.
	The color and style of the lists are cases of scss nesting.
	The color of the text is a reference to the scss variable that I created.
	Visually, there are nested lists in my content.
	The pictures on the page are contained in flexboxes and promote responsive design.

Aboutme.html
	aboutme.html presents facts about my life and personality.
	There is a formatted list with important words in bold and larger font, which demonstrates use of css id selectors. There are 3 difference divs on this page, which use css id selectors the divs each have different font colors but the same font size.

Portfolio.html
	Portfolio.html exhibits my love for the arts. Visual arts and music greatly impact my happiness in life, and I enjoy the process of creating my masterpieces as much as I admire the final result. Dedicating time toward a structured yet creative project practices skills of concentration, dedication, and keen eye.
	All the images are contained in flexboxes with the same dimensions.
	Through the use of id tags, I created an option to jump to another section of the page---Art, Photography, or Music--- in the left side-navigation bar.
